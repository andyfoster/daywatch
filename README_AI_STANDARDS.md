# AI Coding Standards for DayWatch - Summary

## ðŸ“š Documentation Created

I've created comprehensive coding standards and guidelines for AI assistants working on your DayWatch project:

### 1. **AI_CODING_STANDARDS.md** - Complete Guidelines
- Detailed coding standards and best practices
- Step-by-step workflow for making changes
- Testing requirements and debugging process
- Project-specific architecture guidelines
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Code review checklist

### 2. **AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Essential Commands
- Critical workflow summary
- Essential commands and checklist
- Quick reference for immediate use
- Key "never do" and "always do" rules

### 3. **AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md** - For Other AI Tools
- Ready-to-use prompt template for tools like Aider, Roocode, etc.
- Contains all essential rules and context
- Can be copied and pasted when starting work with other AI assistants

### 4. **scripts/validate-project.js** - Automated Validation
- Comprehensive project health check script
- Validates file structure, tests, and code quality
- Can be run with `npm run validate`
- Ensures project integrity before and after changes

## ðŸš¨ Core Principles

### The Golden Rule: **ALWAYS TEST AFTER CHANGES**
```bash
npm run test:run
```

### The Workflow:
1. **Understand** â†’ Use `codebase-retrieval` and `view` tools
2. **Plan** â†’ Make minimal, focused changes
3. **Implement** â†’ Follow existing patterns
4. **Test** â†’ Run tests and fix any failures
5. **Validate** â†’ Ensure functionality works

### The Standards:
- **Incremental changes only** - No large, sweeping modifications
- **Preserve existing functionality** - Never break working features
- **Follow existing patterns** - Maintain code consistency
- **Include error handling** - Always validate inputs and handle errors
- **Test thoroughly** - All tests must pass before considering work complete

## ðŸ”§ Usage Instructions

### For You (Project Owner):
1. **Share these documents** with any AI assistant working on DayWatch
2. **Run validation** before and after AI changes: `npm run validate`
3. **Reference the standards** when giving instructions to AI tools

### For AI Assistants:
1. **Read AI_CODING_STANDARDS.md** before starting any work
2. **Use AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** as a constant reference
3. **Run `npm run test:run`** after every change
4. **Run `npm run validate`** to check project health

### For Other AI Tools (Aider, Roocode, etc.):
1. **Copy the prompt from AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md**
2. **Paste it at the beginning of your session**
3. **Follow the guidelines strictly**

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

These standards ensure:
- **High code quality** - Consistent, maintainable code
- **No breaking changes** - Existing functionality is preserved
- **Comprehensive testing** - All changes are thoroughly tested
- **Clear communication** - AI assistants understand expectations
- **Project stability** - Reduces bugs and regressions

## ðŸš€ Validation Results

The project currently passes all validation checks:
- âœ… All essential files present
- âœ… Test suite comprehensive and passing
- âœ… Import functionality complete
- âœ… No debug code in production
- âœ… HTML structure intact
- âœ… Module architecture maintained

## ðŸ“ž Support

If any AI assistant encounters issues:
1. **Check the standards documents** for guidance
2. **Run the validation script** to identify problems
3. **Ask for clarification** rather than guessing
4. **Focus on understanding** before implementing

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

Your DayWatch project now has enterprise-level coding standards that will:
- Maintain high code quality
- Prevent breaking changes
- Ensure comprehensive testing
- Guide AI assistants effectively
- Scale with project growth

The standards are battle-tested and based on the successful patterns we've established while building the import feature and maintaining the existing codebase.
